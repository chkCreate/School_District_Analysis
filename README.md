# School_District_Analysis
  
## Overview of Project
  
### Purpose
  
The school board has notified that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to our client for help. The client has asked us to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. This report presents some of our findings and summary on the impacts to the statistical results from omiting the subset under investigation.
